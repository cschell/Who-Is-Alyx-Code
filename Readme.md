# Who Is Alyx? Dataset Processing and Models

This repository contains the code used for preprocessing and training the models described in our paper ["Who Is Alyx? A New Behavioral Biometric Dataset for User Identification in XR"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frvir.2023.1272234).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main parts:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for preparing the Who is Alyx dataset for training. For details, see the [preprocessing README](path/to/preprocessing/README.md).

2. **Model Training**: Code for training and evaluating the CNN and GRU models. For details, see the [training README](path/to/training/README.md).
